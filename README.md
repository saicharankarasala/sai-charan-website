## üìù Customization Guide
- **Replace Profile Images**:
    - Locate your profile images in `assets/images/Thumbnail.jpg` and other relevant files in `assets/`.
    - Replace these files with your own images, keeping the same file names or updating the paths in `src/App.jsx` and `README.md` accordingly.
- **Update Social Media URLs**:
    - Open `src/App.jsx`.
    - Find the social links section and update the `href` attributes of the `<a>` tags with your own LinkedIn and email links.
- **Edit Content Sections (About, Skills, Education, Experience, Projects)**:
    - The content for these sections is primarily managed within the `src/App.jsx` file.
    - Edit the text, dates, descriptions, and tech stacks within the respective sections to reflect your own information and achievements.
- **Configure EmailJS**:
    - Open `src/components/Contact.jsx`.
    - Sign up for a free account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
    - Replace the placeholder public key with your actual EmailJS public key.
    - Configure your EmailJS service, template, and account to receive emails.
- **Customize Tailwind Styles**:
    - Tailwind CSS is used for all styling. You can customize the theme (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) by editing `tailwind.config.js`.
    - Modify existing utility classes in your JSX files or add new custom CSS in `src/index.css` using Tailwind's `@apply` directive if needed.
- **Edit Blog Sections & TOC:**
    - To add or update blog sections, edit the relevant components in `src/` and update the TOC/sidebar for new anchor links.
- **Animated Hero Roles:**
  - To customize the animated roles/titles in the hero section, edit the `words` array in the `<Typewriter />` component in `src/App.jsx`.
- **Organization Logos:**
    - Add your organization logos to `public/images/` and update the logo constants in `src/pages/Journey.jsx` and `src/pages/Experience.jsx`.
    - Ensure logos have transparent backgrounds for optimal display.
